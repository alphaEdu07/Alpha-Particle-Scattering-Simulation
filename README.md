# Alpha-Particle-Scattering-Simulation
## About
Alpha-Particle-Scattering-Simulation program helps physics teachers create animations of the Rutherford alpha-scattering experiment without additional effort.

This program is a python program that users can download and use it without the need for additional installation of the program's runtime environment.

## Features
- Easy to use
- Without the need to download other software for run the program
- Code is highly versatile and readable
- The program shows particle scattering trajector video

## Documents
- Rutherford-Scattering-Simulation.exe
This file is the executable file of the program, which can be run directly by clicking on it after downloading.

- Rutherford-Scattering-Simulation.py
This file contains the source code of the program, and users can download it and open it with a compiler to study or modify it according to their needs.

## Quick-start guide
1. Open the file **Rutherford-Scattering-Simulation.exe**
2. Operate user interface
3. Input the parameters into imput boxes of **kineetic energy** and **impact parameter**. Press the button on the left which  allows for manual output of plots. Then you can get a trajector video about the alpha-particles that have parameters that you input.  
4. Or you can choice another mode of generating plots. Press the button on the right which enables the automatic random generation mode for output plots. Then you can get 1,000 alpha-particles scattering trajector video. 

## Used libraries
- tkinter
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
